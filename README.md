# OakHacks
Hackathon

MyClinic is an Appointment Scheduling Application for Clinics. It was created during the 24 hour Oakhacks hackathon. Our team placed in the top 5 teams out of more than 200 participants. We created this application from scratch and were only allowed to work on it for one day. It is only the general structure of the application. You may test some features such as the clinic finder by downloading the repo and opening index.html. More info can be found at our Devpost. We plan on completing MyClinic and releasing it.
